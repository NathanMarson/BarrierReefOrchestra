    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>The Barrier Reef Orchestra is Townsville’s own Community Orchestra, which has up to 70 musicians and stages three concerts each year. It is a volunteer community organisation in its fourteenth year. The orchestra’s players are of all ages and include secondary and tertiary students, music teachers and musicians from all walks of life.</p>
    <p>The aim of the orchestra is to provide an opportunity for musicians to play orchestral music and for the community to have the opportunity to see and hear live orchestral concerts. This is made possible by a combination of generous sponsorship support, concert attendance by the community and the keen involvement of many volunteers both in playing and administration. It is estimated that one year’s operation of the orchestra with three full concerts entails approximately 20,000 volunteer hours in administration, promotion, management, practice, rehearsal and performance. The Orchestra employs a part time manager and invites professional soloists and guest conductors to feature at its concerts.</p>
    <p>Although the orchestra’s players are predominantly drawn from Townsville, musicians from the wider region are encouraged to participate, and sometimes gaps are filled by augmenting players drawn from other centres.</p>
    <p>The Barrier Reef Orchestra’s repertoire over the years has covered a very wide range of music and has featured outstanding, emerging, professional musicians as soloists. Each year one of our concerts features the winner of the Australian Concerto and Vocal Competition which is held each year in Townsville. </p>
