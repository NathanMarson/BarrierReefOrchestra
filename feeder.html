<h1>TWILIGHT</h1>
<p>
    Twilight was a community project to mark the 30th birthday of Dance North. The them of the performance was sensing sea, sky and earth through connection with place. It involved over 150 performers over more than 14 locations on the beautiful headland at Jezzine. It was a a performance in motion with the audience moving from one location to the next shepherded by volunteer guides.</p>
   <p> The performance began before sunset and continued while the sun went down and the horizon changed colour. The later stations were lit by candles and lighting concealer in the vegetation.</p>
    <a> Performances ranged from the Brass members of the <a href="index.html">Barrier Reef Orchestra </a> who could be found at several stations, through school dance students, to the Forever Young over 60s. It included Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander dance and music groups, Kith and Kin, Aquapella, who had just returned from a successful tour to Europe, WASSA, our African drummers and Teepee Parkour who leapt over walls and stairs and were accompanied by Boris doing amazing stunts of his lit up bicycle.</p>
<p> In perhaps a first for Townsville one section of the show involved a mobile phone orchestra. The audience were encouraged to download an app on which original music had been recorded and the audience played this on their phones to accompany a recorder solo.</p>
<p> The finale was with the dancers from Dance North and the BRO Brass playing original music composed by the Musical Director, Ng Chor Ghan from Malaysia. Guan had composed almost all the music for the production. The overall Artistic and Creatuve Direction  was in the hands of Cheryl Stock AM who was the founding Artistic Director of Dance North from 1985 to 1996.</p>
